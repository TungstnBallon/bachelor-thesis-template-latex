	abstract = {Immense improvements in sequencing technologies enable
	            producing large amounts of high throughput and cost effective
	            next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. This data needs to be
	            processed efficiently for further downstream analyses.
	            Computing systems need this large amounts of data closer to
	            the processor (with low latency) for fast and efficient
	            processing. However, existing workflows depend heavily on
	            disk storage and access, to process this data incurs huge
	            disk I/O overheads. Previously, due to the cost, volatility
	            and other physical constraints of DRAM memory, it was not
	            feasible to place large amounts of working data sets in
	            memory. However, recent developments in storage-class memory
	            and non-volatile memory technologies have enabled computing
	            systems to place huge data in memory to process it directly
	            from memory to avoid disk I/O bottlenecks. To exploit the
	            benefits of such memory systems efficiently, proper formatted
	            data placement in memory and its high throughput access is
	            necessary by avoiding (de)-serialization and copy overheads
	            in between processes. For this purpose, we use the newly
	            developed Apache Arrow, a cross-language development
	            framework that provides language-independent columnar
	            in-memory data format for efficient in-memory big data
	            analytics. This allows genomics applications developed in
	            different programming languages to communicate in-memory
	            without having to access disk storage and avoiding
	            (de)-serialization and copy overheads.},

	            widely available alternative industry is considering for
	            higher performance in the data center and cloud is the FPGA
	            accelerator. We discuss several challenges a developer has to
	            face when designing and integrating FPGA accelerators for big
	            data analytics pipelines. On the software side, we observe
	            complex run-time systems, hardware-unfriendly in-memory
	            layouts of data sets, and (de)serialization overhead. On the
	            hardware side, we observe a relative lack of
	            platform-agnostic open-source tooling, a high design effort
	            for data structure-specific interfaces, and a high design
	            effort for infrastructure. The open source Fletcher framework
	            addresses these challenges. It is built on top of Apache
	            Arrow, which provides a common, hardware-friendly in-memory
	            format to allow zero-copy communication of large tabular data
	            , preventing (de)serialization overhead. Fletcher adds FPGA
	            accelerators to the list of over eleven supported software
	            languages. To deal with the hardware challenges, we present
	            Arrow-specific components, providing easy-to-use,
	            high-performance interfaces to accelerated kernels. The
	            components are combined based on a generic architecture that
	            is specialized according to the application through an
	            extensive infrastructure generation framework that is
	            presented in this article. All generated hardware is
	            vendor-agnostic, and software drivers add a platform-agnostic
	            layer, allowing users to create portable implementations.},
