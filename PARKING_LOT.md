- Architecture:
    Cite requirement process
    - Operator type calculators were not changed
        - they dont reflect the actual types of the data during runtime anymore.
        - they still prevent the user from doing illegal stuff.
- Implementation:
    - polarsExpessions:
        - mention that pl.col and pl.lit are the most used ones and what they do
    - paper im workog
- Evaluation:
    - Limitations:
        - could not integrate bach-napi-test into the monorepo
            - esbuild tries to compile everything into a single js file
            - this doesnt work for the binaries generated by napi
        - some floating point values might differ because
            - my implementation uses f64, node uses number with idk how many bits
            - with the conversion to ipc, it might also change things
    - 10 runs for every config
    - manually write down times of each block into a table
    - 5 steps for the lines
    - do stuff like variance
    - utilize jayvees builtin time evaluation
    - calculate
        - time added per added tabletransformer
    - teste null in integer spalten
    - Untershiede ts plobrs MIT BEISPIELEN
        - manche floating point values
            - wahrscheinlich wegen number vs f64 (RESEARCH)
            - immer nur minimale Abweichungen
        - null in textspalten
            - ts hat leere strings


- TODO
    - how to cite images
    - give credit to napi-package-template
