- Architecture:
    - Operator type calculators were not changed
        - they dont reflect the actual types of the data during runtime anymore.
        - they still prevent the user from doing illegal stuff.
    - Include
        - `BlockExecutorClass` defines the Blocktype this executor is for
        - `ConstructorClass` guarantees a constructor
- Evaluation:
    - Limitations:
        - could not integrate bach-napi-test into the monorepo
            - esbuild tries to compile everything into a single js file
            - this doesnt work for the binaries generated by napi
        - some floating point values might differ because
            - my implementation uses f64, node uses number with idk how many bits
            - with the conversion to ipc, it might also change things
    - 10 runs for every config
    - manually write down times of each block into a table
    - 5 steps for the lines
    - do stuff like variance
    - utilize jayvees builtin time evaluation
    - calculate
        - time added per added tabletransformer
- Appendix:
    - sbom
         - table with library name, version, used in (interpreter, rust extension of evaluation tool), source repo


- TODO
    - how to cite images
    - give credit to napi-package-template
